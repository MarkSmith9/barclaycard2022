## Meeting findings
### Client
- The client runs a cheese shop and is looking to digitise it
- The budget the client has in mind is 5k
	- The client also wants to know what the running costs are
- The client can look through mock-ups today (at 3-4ish probably 4) and tomorrow in order to give feedback (15 mins)

### Website
#### Theming
- The website should not be brightly coloured and shouldn't be too attention grabby and should be subtle instead
- A large portion of the market is elderly
#### Features
- The client wants us to look at competitors for features
- The client wants a loyalty scheme but has none at the moment so features of the scheme will need to be decided
- The client wants a guest login
- The client wants to make sure staff can only access their respective store but also wants a super admin that can do everything
- The client wants to be able to see a dashboard with transactions stock etc
- The gateway needs to have reporting
- All stores are individually stocked
- A store view for each store
- E-mail alerts for low stock
	- customisable e-mails could be an extra feature
- Ryan as an example user
- Guides as he has no idea how to use a computer
- High accessibility by having good contrast
- Extra cheeses from competitors (preferably with a pun)

#### Legal requirements
- pci
- gdpr
- disability act




### Misc
- The client is not looking for a too corporate presentation, instead he wants us to build trust and be memorable
	- This is done by standing out and letting our personalities come through
- The client mentioned tokenisation, not sure what it is we should probably look into it
